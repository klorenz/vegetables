# Vegetables roadmap

---
class: center, middle, title

## The future cool features and enhancements

### For now
This is my internal todo list, sorted by priority.  
If you think that some points are more important for you, let me know, I will change priorites. Or you can contribute.


- special pages, to create sitemap, site index, search engine index, ...
- add plugin manager, for markdown to slideshow, search engine (html-to-text), ..., maybe with https://www.npmjs.com/package/polite-plugin-manager
- slideshow content should be a handlebars helper, in order to call it only when required
- optimization: templates and partials should be cleaned only when the file date changes
- sometimes, vegetables serve stops at startup with an error
- option: rename README.md to index.html (default: true)
- tag: sitemap (build a list of generated files, images and linked files)
- tag: toc {label, anchor, level, entries: [...]}
- set .vegetables as a constant or a configuration variable (no... rmrf on a variable seems to be dangerous...)
- prevent from concurrent generation
- tag: if git versions the folder, get the release hash, tag and branch


---
### Later

- remote template checkout: if template is a GitHub address, clone it to .vegetables/git-template and change the internal variable to this path
- new command: ftp-deploy
- HTTP error pages?

# Welcome to the Vegetables documentation

## What is Vegetables?

Vegetables is a static Web site generator, based on Markdown documents.

> What, another one?

Yes... you're right... with its proper lot of lakes and cool features.

And I hope lakes count will decrease quickly.

## Ok, what are the cool features?

### Many formats for the same document

With the same Markdown, it is possible to generate many HTML documents at once.

For example:

- a normal version like the page you are reading
- a Markdown raw version
- and...

### Slideshow-able

...and the same, as slideshows, ready to be displayed with [Remark.js](https://github.com/gnab/remark).

The result: each document is accessible as a slideshow [like this one](index-slideshow.html)

### A lot of customisable tags



### Preview

Start Vegetables once, open you favorite browse, write documents in your text editor, and when you want to view the result, refresh the page. That's all. It's quite simple.

### Easy to use

Type one command line, and the preview is ready.

## And the others?



### Templates

Mustache



## The future

You can take a look at the [roadmap](roadmap.md) page to know what will be the next features (cool or not). For example:

- page layout, to generate specific HTML pages according to the Markdown document
- automatic deployment, on GitHub pages or with FTP on your own Web hosting
- new tags, like toc, partial, sitemap, ...

If you are interested in the past things, go to the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).
